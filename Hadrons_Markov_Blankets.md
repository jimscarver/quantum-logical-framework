## Abstract

In the Quantum Logical Framework (QLF), a **Markov blanket** is the irreducible topological boundary that isolates internal free-energy deficits (paradoxes, unresolved distinctions) while permitting only minimal, statistically predictive interactions with the exterior vacuum.  

At the hadron scale, blankets form through interlocking fractional twists (e.g., three quarks forming a proton via Borromean-ring topology). The 21 April 2026 gauge-folding rule extends this principle to the **particle scale**:  
- **Gauge-folded particles** (`+`–`−` twists) possess a **Planck-scale Markov blanket** that functions as a primordial black-hole horizon.  
- Constructing delay creates local time inside the blanket; ZFA closure triggers **immediate Hawking radiation** as an active-inference handshake across the boundary.  
- **Non-gauge particles** have no blanket horizon — they create local space only and require no radiation.  

This unification shows that hadronic stability, particle-scale black-hole behavior, and Hawking radiation are all manifestations of the **same blanket strategy** operating at different logical densities. All behavior is native to `particles.py`, `blanket_kinematics.py`, and the QuCalc rewrite rules.

## 1. What a Markov Blanket Is in QLF

A Markov blanket is formed when open fractional strings interlock such that:
- Internal gauge twists (`+`–`−`) are routed and resolved **inside** the blanket.
- Only controlled re-entries reach the exterior history string.
- The blanket itself is a closed topological loop satisfying ZFA from the observer’s viewpoint.

This boundary screens entropy (unresolved distinctions) while allowing the system to “anticipate and deflect” the vacuum’s ZFA-pruning pressure — the essence of active inference in QLF.

## 2. Blankets at the Hadron Scale

- Three quarks (open strings) interlock via Borromean topology → proton blanket.  
- Internal gauge folds handle color and weak interactions; electromagnetic and spatial folds remain partially exposed.  
- The blanket isolates the internal free-energy deficit, making the hadron stable against the dense vacuum ecology.  
- The composite blanket **is** a horizon (every hadron is a Markov-blanket quantum black hole — see [Hadron_BlackHoles.md](Hadron_BlackHoles.md)); it does not radiate *while its gauge/chirality stays hidden* inside the Borromean closure (the stable proton). A hadron that **exposes** its chirality — the pion, a `q q̄` Goldstone (see [Pion_QLF.md](Pion_QLF.md), `m_π±/m_e = 2/α`) — has a radiating horizon, and that radiation **is** its decay (Hawking evaporation). Hidden vs exposed chirality fixes both the mass factor (`π⁵` vs `1/α`) and the horizon's fate.

## 3. Gauge Folding Creates Microscopic (Particle-Scale) Blankets (New Rule)

The presence of **LOCAL gauge twists** (`+` and `-`) upgrades a particle to a primordial quantum black hole with its own Planck-scale blanket:

- **Gauge-folded particles** (`+`–`−`):  
  - Blanket = horizon.  
  - Constructing delay \(\Delta t = R / f\) accumulates local time inside the blanket.  
  - Exact ZFA closure requires one-step horizon re-entry → **immediate Hawking radiation** (`+-` pair).  
  - This radiation is the minimal active-inference handshake: the blanket statistically synchronizes with the exterior vacuum while preserving global unitarity.

- **Non-gauge particles** (no `+` or `-`):  
  - No blanket forms.  
  - Pure spatial closure creates local space only.  
  - Zero delay, zero horizon, zero radiation.

This is the microscopic origin of the black-hole / particle equivalence: every gauge-folded particle **is** a primordial quantum black hole whose Markov blanket produces Hawking radiation exactly as macroscopic horizons do.

## 4. Active Inference Across the Blanket

The blanket does not passively screen information — it **actively infers** the vacuum’s ZFA requirements:
- It “predicts” the next logical pruning step.
- It deflects that pressure by internal rerouting of gauge twists.
- At the particle scale, the minimal deflection is a single re-entry unwind → Hawking pair emission.

This active-inference view unifies:
- Hadronic stability (macroscopic blanket).
- Primordial black-hole radiation (microscopic blanket).
- Thermodynamic arrow of time (blanket progressively pushes unresolved distinctions into the future light-cone).

## 5. Computational Verification

Run the updated engine to see blankets in action:

```bash
python particles.py --seed "^+" --max-depth 6 --enable-gauge --show-density-swap
```

Typical gauge-fold output:
```text
Topology          : ^+v-
Classification    : primordial_BH
Constructing Delay: 4 cycles
Creates local     : time
Logical Density   : HIGH → time is the local axis
Hawking Radiation : +-     ← active-inference handshake across Planck-scale blanket
```

Spatial-only seed produces:
```text
Classification    : massless_particle
Creates local     : space
(No blanket, no radiation)
```

The same `blanket_kinematics.py` module now treats the `+`–`−` gauge fold as a microscopic horizon, confirming the continuum from hadrons to primordial black holes.

- [`Active_Inference_Mathematics.md`](Active_Inference_Mathematics.md): The Markov blanket developed here is one of the three primitives of active-inference math (§2 of the meta-doc) — the agent boundary inside every closure.
- [`Emergent_Markov_Blankets.md`](Emergent_Markov_Blankets.md): Applies the multi-scale blanket primitive at the **quiet-frequency-isolated atom-group scale** for crystal-QPU logical-qubit emergence (resonant groups of ~10–10⁶ atoms forming deep collective fluxoids); the natural mid-scale layer between single-defect qubits and macroscopic-collective registers.
- [`Proton_Resonance_R_e.md`](Proton_Resonance_R_e.md): The 3-quark Borromean closure structure articulated here is the scaffolding for the chirality-hiding-resonance derivation of the electron mass. Under that reading, the proton's Borromean topology is selected by evolutionary stability against electron annihilation: only configurations with hidden chirality survive, and the proton is the minimum-complexity such configuration. The electron's Compton frequency `R_e = R_p · 6π⁵` is the resonance threshold matching the proton's chirality-screening structure.

## Conclusion

Markov blankets are the universal boundary strategy of QLF — from hadrons to primordial black holes. The gauge-folding rule makes this strategy computable at the particle scale: every `+`–`−` fold creates a Planck-scale blanket that isolates internal distinctions, accumulates local time, and produces unitary Hawking radiation as an active-inference handshake. Non-gauge particles require no blanket and simply expand local space.  

This single mechanism scales seamlessly from quark confinement to black-hole thermodynamics and the cosmological arrow of time — all without extra postulates, all native to the updated QuCalc engine.
