# Positioning — the most falsifiable theory of everything

**What this doc is:** the brand reference for how to talk about the [Quantum Logical Framework](README.md)
in public — which hooks recruit which audiences, in what order, and what stays out of the shop window.
It is internal-facing strategy plus ready-to-post copy; it makes no physics claims of its own, only
points at claims proven elsewhere in the repo.

**The position, in one line:** *the most falsifiable theory of everything.* It is accurate, it is a
slot no rival occupies, and it converts the biggest rhetorical liability — open gaps — into the brand.
The genuine competitive advantage here is not any single physics result; it is the **honesty
infrastructure**: epistemic tags, misses carried at full weight, a published defeater table, and
machine-checked boundaries. Most projects would have to *build* that to earn this framing. QLF only has
to point at what already exists.

## Part 1 — The layered hooks (in recruitment order)

Different hooks recruit different audiences, and the wrong hook recruits the wrong audience
permanently. Lead with the one nobody can attack; let the rest unroll from it.

### Hook 1 (lead) — "No measurement has ever produced a real number."

This is the strongest opener precisely because **it is not a QLF claim — it is a fact about metrology**
most physicists have never consciously registered. Every measurement in history is a count plus an
interval; `α⁻¹ = 137.035999206(11)` is a rational plus a rational interval, nothing more. Frequency
metrology, the most precise measurement humans perform, is literally integer cycle counting, and the
2019 SI redefinition makes it explicit top to bottom: the units are fixed by exact stipulated constants
and measurement is counting against them. Uncomputable reals are not merely never measured — they are
unmeasurable *in principle*, because any measurement protocol is a finite procedure.

**Why it works:** it is arresting, unattackable, and it does the framing work for you. Once someone
accepts it, the next question asks itself — *so why is physics written in a language whose objects can
never appear in any lab?* — and QLF walks in as the answer rather than as a claim needing defense.

**Anchor:** [`Completeness_Evidence.md`](Completeness_Evidence.md) §2a; machine-checked in
[`QLF_PiRational`](lean/QLF_PiRational.lean) (the substrate π-approximant is rational by construction)
and [`QLF_Identifiability`](lean/QLF_Identifiability.lean) (a real is identifiable only if computable;
the tail no finite record can pin is the full continuum).

### Hook 2 (identity) — the falsifier table as the brand.

Every theory-of-everything-adjacent project on the internet claims to derive constants; approximately
zero publish a table of named defeaters. QLF publishes **seven experiments that would kill it**
([`Completeness_Evidence.md`](Completeness_Evidence.md) §4c):

| If this is observed… | …ZFA-only is dead |
|---|---|
| A confirmed cosmological drift in α | `no_cosmological_drift_of_alpha` |
| An axion detection | `θ̄ = 0` with **no axion** (`theta_zero_on_closure`) |
| An exhaustive-sensitivity 0νββ null (LEGEND/nEXO) | Majorana neutrino (`neutrino_majorana`) |
| Exact global B−L conservation established | no exact global B−L |
| A physically realized Navier–Stokes blow-up | no blow-up in preparable flows |
| A predeclared-sieve QRNG deviation | streams match the ZFA-closure null |
| A muon g−2 anomaly surviving HVP settlement | no new-physics anomaly |

**Why it works:** it is close to unique in the genre and it is the single fastest way to separate from
the crank cluster in a physicist's pattern-matching. Standing public predictions are also *content that
ages into evidence* — every year the axion isn't found, the post rewrites itself. The framing sentence:
**"Most theories of everything ask for belief. This one publishes its kill conditions."**

### Hook 3 (participation) — physics as a repo you can PR.

This is the growth mechanism, not just framing. The Lean layer means the honest pitch is *don't trust
us — clone it, run `lake build`, the proofs check or they don't.* No other foundational-physics project
offers **machine-verifiable skepticism**. That recruits exactly the demographic that spreads things —
programmers and the Lean / formal-methods community — who will engage with QLF as an artifact before
they buy the physics. The [QRNG Closure Observatory](QRNG_Closure_Observatory.md) extends the same move
to data: a citizen-falsification experiment. Open issues with graded difficulty turn spectators into
contributors, and contributors into advocates.

**Anchor:** the Lean sources build clean across **more than a hundred machine-checked modules** with
zero `sorry`; [`QRNG_Closure_Observatory.md`](QRNG_Closure_Observatory.md); the graded open-problem
issues.

### Hook 4 (the one journalist-ready result) — `a₀ = cH₀/2π` on SPARC.

Every popularization needs one concrete story. This is it: one formula, zero knobs, blind-tested
against **147 real galaxies** (2696 points), landing at the observational floor.

- QLF, parameter-free, with the *derived* `a₀ = cH₀/2π`: **0.133 dex** scatter, **zero** systematic
  offset.
- Newton (no dark matter): a `+0.431 dex` offset — a factor **2.7×** of "missing gravity."
- NFW dark-matter halos: fit tighter (0.059 dex) but only by handing **2 free parameters to every
  galaxy — 294 in total**; it absorbs the scatter rather than predicting it.

**Why it works:** dark matter is a famous mystery, "parameter-free" is explainable in one sentence, and
the claim is checkable (the pipeline is sealed and reproducible). **Anchor:** [`SPARC.md`](SPARC.md),
[`sparc/receipt.json`](sparc/receipt.json), [`DarkMatter.md`](DarkMatter.md).

## Part 2 — The keep-out list (what backfires)

The pattern behind all of these: **every framing that borrows prestige from a famous target backfires;
every framing that exhibits your own discipline compounds.**

- **Derived-α claims stronger than the proven bounds.** What is machine-checked is the *interval*
  `137 < α⁻¹ < 137.048` ([`QLF_AlphaBound`](lean/QLF_AlphaBound.lean)), with the residual to the
  measured `137.036…` openly tracked. Overclaim a from-scratch derivation and the gap gets found by the
  second commenter and *becomes the story*. Keep α out of the lead; if it appears, state only the
  proven bound.
- **Anything Clay-prize-flavored.** The Millennium interfaces get an instant crank classification
  regardless of how carefully they are hedged. The registry's own framing — *translation of the problem
  into the substrate, not a solution* — is correct and belongs in the technical docs; it stays out of
  promotional copy entirely.
- **"ZFC is wrong."** The precise version is *overcomplete, not inconsistent* (a finite-information
  universe cannot instantiate the continuum's surplus distinctions; consistency ≠ realizability). The
  imprecise version is a credibility bomb. Prefer the measurement hook, which says the same thing
  without the category error.
- **Hegel / dialectics.** Real content for [`Philosophy.md`](Philosophy.md) §9; pure crank-signal in
  outreach. Same for any other borrowed-prestige philosophical lineage.

## Part 3 — Ready-to-post thread (measurement hook)

A worked example of Part 1 as a launch thread. Every factual claim is cross-checked against the repo.
Trim to platform length as needed; the first post is the whole pitch if only one lands.

> **1/** No measurement in the history of physics has ever produced a real number.
>
> Every result is a count plus an interval. α⁻¹ = 137.035999206(11) — a rational, plus a rational
> error bar. That's it. That's all any lab has ever handed you.

> **2/** Frequency metrology — the most precise measurement humans do — is literally counting cycles.
> Since the 2019 SI redefinition it's explicit all the way down: the units are fixed integers, and

> kill it — and hands you the tools to try.
