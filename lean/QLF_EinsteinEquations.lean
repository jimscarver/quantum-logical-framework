# QLF_EinsteinEquations — the Einstein equations as the substrate's equation of state (Jacobson)

QLF already had Newton's law, `G = L_P²c³/ℏ`, the Mercury perihelion, and the weak-field
Schwarzschild metric — but the **full** field equations `G_μν = (8πG/c⁴) T_μν` were flagged open
(only the `8π` factor + the weak-field limit). The honest route to the full equations is
**Jacobson (1995)**: the Einstein equations are *not* a fundamental dynamical law but the
**equation of state** of horizon thermodynamics — they follow from demanding the Clausius relation
`δQ = T δS` on every local Rindler horizon, with `T` the Unruh temperature and `S` the
Bekenstein–Hawking area entropy.

This fits QLF perfectly, because QLF supplies **both** of Jacobson's inputs *from its own
substrate*:

* the **area law** `S = 4π R² log 2` (`holographic_entropy_eq`, `QLF_GravityFromDelay`) — entropy
  density `η = 1/(4G)` in the continuum coarse-graining (the `log 2 / 4` gap is the
  substrate→continuum factor noted there), and
* the **Unruh temperature** `T = ℏκ/(2π c k_B)` (`QLF_HorizonTemperature`).

With these, Jacobson's derivation forces the field-equation coefficient to be the **Unruh `2π`
over the entropy density**:

  `8πG = 2π / η = 2π · 4G`   (`einstein_coupling_from_thermodynamics`),

and the same `8π` is QLF's `8π = 4π·2` (`QLF_EinsteinGeometricFactor`). The integration constant of
Jacobson's derivation is the cosmological constant `Λ` — which QLF fixes independently as
`Ω_Λ = log 2` (`QLF_CosmologicalConstant`). So the Einstein equations are the equation of state of
the substrate, with every coefficient assembled from QLF's own thermodynamics.

## Honest scope

This anchors the **coefficient and the thermodynamic skeleton** — `8πG = 2π/η`, both inputs being
QLF substrate results, reproducing Jacobson's "Einstein equation of state." It does **not** carry
out the full tensor derivation: the local Rindler construction, the Raychaudhuri focusing equation,
and general covariance need differential-geometry machinery QLF's Lean core does not have — the
same dynamical-metric step still open for the Schwarzschild metric and gravitational waves
(`einstein_equations_in_progress`). See `GR_Schwarzschild.md`.
