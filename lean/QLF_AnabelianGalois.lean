# QLF_AnabelianGalois — closing the anabelian exact sequence on the substrate

The two ends of Grothendieck's anabelian picture, now both built in QLF, meet here:

* the **geometric `π₁`** — the anabelian future-cone functor `closurePi1` (`QLF_Anabelian`), from
  which geometry is recovered from the combinatorial closure;
* the **arithmetic motivic Galois group** — `MotiveAut` / the `H↔H†` element `weightConjAut`
  (`QLF_MotivicGalois`).

The bridge is structural and exact: a **`Motive`'s closure is literally an anabelian `Event`** (both
are `List Twist`), so the motivic Galois group acts on the very objects the anabelian functor sees. And
the action factors exactly as the anabelian exact sequence demands —

  `1 → π₁^{geom} → π₁^{arith} → Gal → 1` :

`weightConjAut` moves the *weight* (the arithmetic enrichment, the cohomological `H↔H†` grading) while
leaving the *closure* — the geometric `π₁` data — untouched (`motive_closure_galois_invariant`). So the
geometric `π₁` is the **kernel** of the arithmetic Galois action (`anabelian_galois_equivariant`), and
the Galois group acts faithfully on the enrichment (`galois_acts_on_weight`).

## Why this helps the Millennium program

The `H↔H†` involution is the *shared* spine of QLF's Millennium attacks — the **Riemann** critical line,
the **BSD** central point, and the **Hodge** diagonal are all its self-dual fixed locus
(`bsd_riemann_shared_involution`, `functional_equation_fixed_real`). Until now that involution was a
*posited* reflection in each module; it is now a **verified element of the motivic Galois group**
(`weightConjAut`), whose self-dual locus is exactly the Hodge/Tate diagonal (`galois_fixed_iff_hodge`,
reused). So the three Millennium self-dual loci are one motivic-Galois involution, and the
anabelian/Galois backbone of the BSD–Langlands–Riemann circle is closed on the substrate. This is a
**grounding + unification** (the per-module continuum boundaries are unchanged); it puts the Millennium
problems on the richer Grothendieck foundation, foundation-up. No new axioms.

/-- **The arithmetic motivic Galois group fixes the geometric `π₁`.** The `H↔H†` Galois element
    `weightConjAut` acts on a motive's *weight* (the arithmetic enrichment) but leaves its *closure* —
    the geometric `π₁` data of `QLF_Anabelian` — untouched. -/
theorem motive_closure_galois_invariant (m : Motive) :
    (weightConjAut.act m).closure = m.closure := rfl

/-- **The anabelian reconstruction is motivic-Galois-equivariant** — the geometry recovered from the
    closure (`closurePi1`) is invariant under the arithmetic Galois action. The geometric `π₁` is the
    **kernel** of the arithmetic Galois action: the anabelian exact sequence
    `1 → π₁^{geom} → π₁^{arith} → Gal → 1`, realized on the substrate. -/
theorem anabelian_galois_equivariant (m : Motive) :
    closurePi1 (weightConjAut.act m).closure = closurePi1 m.closure := rfl

/-- **The arithmetic side genuinely moves**: `weightConjAut` conjugates the weight (the `H↔H†` Galois
    action on the cohomological grading), so the sequence is non-trivial — the Galois group acts on the
    enrichment while fixing the geometry. -/
theorem galois_acts_on_weight (m : Motive) :
    (weightConjAut.act m).weight = m.weight.conj := rfl

/-- **The Galois-fixed locus is the Hodge/Tate diagonal** (reused) — a motive's weight is fixed by the
    motivic Galois `H↔H†` iff it is a Hodge class, the *same* self-dual locus that is the Riemann
    critical line and the BSD central point. The three Millennium self-dual loci are one
    motivic-Galois involution. -/
theorem galois_fixed_iff_hodge (m : Motive) :
    m.weight.conj = m.weight ↔ m.weight.isHodge :=
  Motive.weight_selfDual_iff_hodge m

/-- **Milestone — the anabelian exact sequence on the substrate.** The geometric `π₁` (`closurePi1`,
    `QLF_Anabelian`) is the kernel of the arithmetic motivic Galois action (`weightConjAut`,
    `QLF_MotivicGalois`): the Galois group moves the weight (`galois_acts_on_weight`) while fixing the
    closure (`motive_closure_galois_invariant`), so the anabelian reconstruction is Galois-equivariant
    (`anabelian_galois_equivariant`). The `H↔H†` involution that is the Riemann critical line, the BSD
    central point, and the Hodge diagonal is now one verified motivic-Galois element
    (`galois_fixed_iff_hodge`). No new axioms; the per-module continuum boundaries are unchanged. -/
