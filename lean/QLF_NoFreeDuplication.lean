# QLF_NoFreeDuplication — the substrate forbids free Banach–Tarski duplication

The Banach–Tarski paradox (Banach & Tarski 1924) uses the Axiom of Choice to cut a solid ball into
finitely many pieces and reassemble them into **two** identical balls — volume conjured from nothing,
duplication for free. QLF's stance (`Banach_Tarski_QLF.md`, `Continuum_Choice_Fallacy.md`,
`TheContinuum.md`) is that this is the cleanest **impossible mathematics**: AC is *false in the
intended physical model*, and the QLF substrate admits no such free copy — every real duplication must
**buy distinguishability and pay in information**.

This module anchors that "no free duplication" principle as a *reuse-corollary* of three already-
verified facts (it does **not** formalize Banach–Tarski itself — BT is a real, consistent ZFC theorem;
the claim is consistency ≠ realizability, not inconsistency):

* **`identical_copy_pauli_blocked`** — two *identical* offspring closures have no bound fermionic
  channel (`fermi_antisym p p = 0`): you cannot make a second identical copy share the closure. The
  substrate's no-cloning / no-diproton (reuses `QLF.Fusion.diproton_pauli_blocked = pauli_exclusion`).
  `fermi_antisym` is **not** identically zero (`fermi_nonzero_example`), so this is a genuine
  constraint on *identical* copies, not a vacuous identity.
* **`realizable_duplication_needs_distinguishability`** — a viable one-becomes-two needs a
  *distinguishable* channel: the identical pair is blocked while a distinguishable Hermitian pair
  closes to identity (reuses `QLF.Fusion.pp_join_requires_distinguishability`, the β⁺ keystone). The
  same move at every scale — nucleonic `p+p` needs a `u→d` β⁺ step, cellular mitosis needs two
  distinguishable daughters.
* **`duplication_pays_log_two`** — making the one distinguishing bit is a half-spin ZFA closure
  costing `ΔF = −log 2` nats (Landauer; reuses `QLF.zfa_closure_minimizes_free_energy`). You cannot get
  two distinguishable closures from one for free.

So no-cloning ↔ no-diproton ↔ no-free-mitosis ↔ no-Banach–Tarski: one principle — *all real duplication
buys distinguishability and pays in energy/time/information*. Banach–Tarski is what duplication looks
like with that ledger dropped (AC's free choice); mitosis is what it looks like with the ledger kept
(ZFA closure).

**The free-group angle (does the substrate's free generation enable a paradox?).** The substrate *does*
generate freely — the free twist-monoid has exponential `4^n` possibility (the `C(2n,n)` census), the
combinatorial analog of Banach–Tarski's free group `F₂` (exponential word growth). QLF concedes the free
engine; it is **not** "too poor" to have one. But a paradoxical decomposition needs more than freeness:
by Tarski's theorem it needs the acting group to be **non-amenable** (no invariant finitely-additive
measure), AND it needs an uncountable continuum to act on plus the Axiom of Choice to select
non-measurable orbit representatives. The substrate supplies none of these:
* `zfa_charge_additive` — every signed twist count is a **conserved additive invariant** (a homomorphism
  to `(ℤ, +)`); the substrate has the invariant mean `F₂` lacks (amenability by construction).
* `closure_folds_to_finite_group` — the closure fold lands in the **finite** (hence amenable) Pauli
  group, so no paradox lives in the rendering.
* the substrate is countable / finite-information (`no_continuum_in_finite_region`, `QLF_Realizability`),
  with no uncountable orbit space, and `full_zeno_prune` replaces AC.
So the freeness is real but harmless; Banach–Tarski's teeth are the continuum + Choice + non-amenability
layered on top, exactly the layers QLF omits.

## Honest scope

The three facts are **already proven** and reused here, no new axioms, no `sorry`. Banach–Tarski itself
is **not** formalized (it needs measure theory + a free-group paradoxical decomposition, and QLF's
point is precisely that those objects are non-realizable, not that they're inconsistent). The
mitosis/cellular reading is a *structural analogy* (Markov-blanket fission as the biological instance of
paid duplication), not a derivation of cell biology. See `Banach_Tarski_QLF.md`.

/-- **Realizable duplication needs distinguishability.** The identical pair is Pauli-blocked
    (`fermi_antisym p p = 0`, left) while a *distinguishable* Hermitian pair closes to identity
    (right): a viable one-becomes-two must make a real difference, not copy for free. Direct reuse of

/-- **The ZFA charge is a conserved, finitely-additive invariant** — a homomorphism
    `(TopoString, ++) → (ℤ, +)` (direct reuse of `wcount_append`). This is the free-group angle on
    Banach–Tarski: by Tarski's theorem a set admits a paradoxical decomposition **iff** the acting
    group is *non-amenable* — admits **no** invariant finitely-additive measure. The free group `F₂`
    (Banach–Tarski's engine) is the canonical non-amenable group; the QLF substrate, by contrast,
    carries such an invariant *by construction* — every signed twist count is a conserved additive
    charge — so the free twist-monoid cannot host a paradoxical doubling. The ZFA balance **is** the
    invariant mean that `F₂` lacks. -/

    `count_balanced_pauli_closed`): a count-balanced twist history renders to a `PauliScalar` — an
    element of the finite (order-16) Pauli group, which is **amenable**. So although the substrate
    *generates* freely (the free twist-monoid, exponential `4^n` possibility, the `C(2n,n)` census —
    the combinatorial analog of `F₂`'s exponential word growth), its *physical image* under the
    closure fold is a finite, amenable group: no paradoxical decomposition lives in the rendering.
    Banach–Tarski's freeness-on-the-continuum is exactly what the finite fold excludes. -/

/-- **Established (the no-free-duplication principle, by reuse):** identical copies are Pauli-blocked
    (`identical_copy_pauli_blocked`), a realizable one-becomes-two needs distinguishable products
    (`realizable_duplication_needs_distinguishability`), and minting the distinguishing bit pays
    `ΔF = −log 2` (`duplication_pays_log_two`). On the free-group angle: the substrate generates freely
    yet hosts no paradox — it carries a conserved additive invariant (`zfa_charge_additive`) and folds
    to a finite, amenable group (`closure_folds_to_finite_group`), so Banach–Tarski's non-amenable
    `F₂`-on-the-continuum never forms. The substrate's "no free Banach–Tarski," one principle behind
    no-cloning, the no-diproton, and mitosis. No new axioms. See `Banach_Tarski_QLF.md`. -/
