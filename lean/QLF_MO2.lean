# QLF_MO2 — the minimal quantum logic `MO2`, self-contained (a one-file, afternoon audit)

**This file has NO QLF dependencies — it imports only Mathlib.** It is the standalone verification of
the signature `[proven]` result of [`Quantum_Logic_Foundations.md`](../Quantum_Logic_Foundations.md)
(issue #132): *the substrate realizes a genuinely quantum logic*, i.e. an **orthocomplemented,
orthomodular, non-distributive** proposition lattice — the minimal such lattice, `MO2`. A skeptic can
copy this single file, run `lake build` against a Mathlib toolchain, and check every claim below; each
is closed by `decide` (a finite, mechanical check over the six-element lattice), so nothing rests on
trust. (The in-tree version with the physics hooks is [`lean/QLF_QuantumLogic.lean`](QLF_QuantumLogic.lean).)

## Audit checklist (what to verify)
1. `QL` is a finite six-element type: `⊥`, the two incompatible atoms `ax`, `az` (the x-spin and z-spin
   closures), their orthocomplements `axp`, `azp`, and `⊤`.
2. `le` is a **partial order** (`le_refl`, `le_trans`, `le_antisymm`).
3. `compl` is an **orthocomplement**: involutive (`compl_involutive`), order-reversing
   (`compl_antitone`), with `a ∧ a⊥ = ⊥` (`inf_compl_bot`) and `a ∨ a⊥ = ⊤` (`sup_compl_top`).
4. The lattice is **orthomodular** (`orthomodular`, the defining law of quantum logic) …
5. … but provably **NOT distributive** (`not_distributive`) — the feature that makes it *quantum*.

Every one is `by decide`. The physical reason the two atoms are incompatible (their Pauli operators do
not commute, `σz σx − σx σz = 2i σy ≠ 0`) is verified separately in `QLF_Spin`/`QLF_QuantumLogic`; it is
not needed to check the lattice claims here, which stand on their own.

theorem le_trans : ∀ a b c : QL, le a b = true → le b c = true → le a c = true := by decide

/-- **The orthocomplement is an involution** `a⊥⊥ = a`. -/
theorem compl_involutive : ∀ a : QL, compl (compl a) = a := by decide

/-- **The orthocomplement is order-reversing** `a ≤ b ⟹ b⊥ ≤ a⊥`. -/
theorem compl_antitone : ∀ a b : QL, le a b = true → le (compl b) (compl a) = true := by decide

/-- **`a ∧ a⊥ = ⊥`** — a proposition and its orthocomplement are disjoint (the singlet closure). -/
theorem inf_compl_bot : ∀ a : QL, inf a (compl a) = bot := by decide

/-- **`a ∨ a⊥ = ⊤`** — a proposition and its orthocomplement span everything (excluded middle,
    orthogonal form). -/
theorem sup_compl_top : ∀ a : QL, sup a (compl a) = top := by decide

/-! ### The orthomodular law — and non-distributivity (genuinely quantum) -/

/-- **The orthomodular law** `a ≤ b ⟹ b = a ∨ (a⊥ ∧ b)` — the defining law of quantum logic, weaker
    than distributivity, machine-verified. -/
theorem orthomodular : ∀ a b : QL, le a b = true → b = sup a (inf (compl a) b) := by decide

/-- **NOT distributive — genuinely quantum.** For the incompatible atoms `ax`, `az`:
    `ax ∧ (az ∨ az⊥) = ax ∧ ⊤ = ax`, but `(ax ∧ az) ∨ (ax ∧ az⊥) = ⊥ ∨ ⊥ = ⊥ ≠ ax`. The distributive
    law fails exactly for incompatible propositions — true quantum logic, not the Boolean shadow. -/
theorem not_distributive :
    ∃ a b c : QL, inf a (sup b c) ≠ sup (inf a b) (inf a c) :=
  ⟨ax, az, azp, by decide⟩

/-- **Verified, self-contained:** `QL` is an orthocomplemented, orthomodular, non-distributive lattice
    — the minimal quantum logic `MO2`. Quantum logic's defining feature (non-distributivity for
    incompatible propositions) is *realized, not analogized*, and checkable from this one Mathlib-only
    file. -/
