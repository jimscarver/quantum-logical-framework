# ER = EPR from the QLF core — entanglement is a shared primordial closure

Earlier this module *posited* the wormhole / shared-constraint relation as seven standalone axioms,
which made the conclusion conditional on those posits (the "speculative" reading). Here the same
conclusion is **derived from the verified core, with no new axioms**:

* **EPR (entanglement) = a shared ZFA closure.** Two histories are entangled iff they *close
  together* — their joint history achieves Zero Free Action (`achieves_ZFA`, `QLF_Axioms`). One
  balanced closure spans both; they are two readings of one closure, not two things that correlate.
* **ER (the wormhole) = that shared closure rendered in the causal geometry as a non-causal
  connection.** Geometry is the *rendering* of closures, and the substrate causal order is
  `reachable` (prefix, `QLF_ReachableEvent`). A bridge is a shared closure between *spacelike*
  events — a real connection (one closure) with no causal path (non-traversable).
* **ER = EPR** (`er_equals_epr`). Given spacelike separation, the geometric bridge exists *exactly*
  when the histories are entangled — the bridge IS the shared closure. Not a duality; an identity.
* **No FTL** (`no_ftl_in_epr`). The bridge is spacelike, so neither end reaches the other: nothing is
  transmitted *through* the geometry — the two ends are one closure that space is synthesized around.

**Distance is a matter of perspective.** Geometry — hence distance — is synthesized per observer
(`SpaceTime.md`); the bridge has **zero closure-distance** (one closure) while the rendered spatial
separation, large or small, is the observer's frame. So "how far apart" the entangled ends are is
*perspectival*: zero through the closure, large through synthesized space — the same relation read
from two frames. The witness is the **primordial entangled pair** — the conjugate `[+, −]` that
closes (the substrate singlet, cf. `opposite_spin_singlet_closes`, `QLF_Spin`;
`Primordial_Entanglement.md`).

    (`er_equals_epr`, `entanglement_is_logical_wormhole`) and no-FTL (`no_ftl_in_epr`) are derived
    from `achieves_ZFA` (the ZFA filter) and `reachable` (the substrate causal set), with a verified
    witness (`primordial_wormhole`). The seven posited axioms are gone. Non-locality dissolves: the
    two ends are one closure; distance is perspectival (zero through the closure, large through
    synthesized space). See `ER_EPR_QLF.md`, `Primordial_Entanglement.md`. -/
