# QLF_AlphaBound — what the substrate FORCES about α, short of deriving the value

The leading combinatorial coupling (`QLF_FineStructureSubstrate`) is

  α⁻¹_lead = 1/α_bare + d² = 128 + 9 = 137   (exact rational, no observable input)

while the measured value (CODATA, q²→0 / Thomson) is α⁻¹ = 137.035999….  Deriving the
residual `+0.036` — i.e. the *exact* value — is the open problem
(`alpha_exact_value_in_progress`, `Alpha.md` status box; memory `alpha-residual-036`).

This module records, machine-checked, only what is *forced* — bounds, not the value:

* **Unconditional `α⁻¹ > 137`.**  EM is abelian (`QLF_GaugeUnification.em_gauge_abelian`,
  U(1), no self-interaction) ⟹ every higher-order closure correction *screens* (is
  positive) ⟹ the IR coupling is weaker than the leading value.  A falsifiable
  before-data inequality (a measured `α⁻¹ ≤ 137` would refute the screening picture);
  CODATA `137.036 > 137`.  (`alpha_inv_gt_137`)

* **A census bracket containing the measured residual** (conditional on one `α_bare`
  per closure order — the standard one-coupling-power-per-loop counting).  Higher
  closures are counted by the closure census: total `C(2n,n) = 2,6,20,70` and
  irreducible/prime `2·Catalan(n−1) = 2,2,4,10`.  The residual is bracketed by the
  irreducible leading term below and the total census orders + tail majorant above; the
  measured `0.035999` lies strictly inside.  (`codata_residual_in_census_bracket`)

* **Falsifiability of the counting rule.**  A steeper map (`α_bare²` per order) caps the
  residual far below `0.036`, excluding it — so the data *requires* the shallow map.
  (`steep_map_excludes_codata`)

NOT proven here, by design: the length→order suppression rule itself, which would turn
the bracket into the value.  Candidate routes (memory `alpha-residual-036`): a curvature
correction to `N = d²` (`QLF_CausalDimension`), or the irreducible-closure generating
function `1 − √(1−4x)`.  Discipline: derive the rule first, evaluate second — never tune
to `0.036`.  Status: `alpha_bound_forced`, value `alpha_exact_value_in_progress`.

/-! ### The exact `√62` upper limit, via the central-binomial generating function

The total-closure tail is summed in closed form, formalizing the `√62` cap.  The one analytic
input — the central-binomial generating function `∑ C(2n,n) xⁿ = (1−4x)^(−1/2)`, a classical
theorem living above the substrate's RCA₀ floor — is named explicitly as an axiom, per the QLF
analysis-boundary convention (cf. `spectral_hilbert_polya`, `yang_mills_continuum_gap`).  The
tail is *defined constructively* from the census counts, and everything around the boundary is
proved. -/

/-- The total-closure screening tail at `α_bare = 1/128`, one `α_bare` per closure order:
    `∑_{n≥2} C(2n,n)·α_bare^(n−1)` — a convergent real series built from the census counts. -/
noncomputable def censusTail : ℝ :=
  ∑' n : ℕ, (if 2 ≤ n then (Nat.centralBinom n : ℝ) * (1 / 128 : ℝ) ^ (n - 1) else 0)

/-- **Central-binomial generating function** — the analysis-boundary input.  Classically
    `∑_{n} C(2n,n) xⁿ = (1−4x)^(−1/2)` for `|x| < 1/4`; specialized and reindexed at `x = 1/128`
    the tail above evaluates to `128·(√(32/31) − 65/64) = 512·√62/31 − 130`.  A known theorem,
    not yet in this Mathlib; named per the QLF boundary-axiom convention. -/
