# QLF_AlphaBound — α's derived leading value, and bounds on the open residual

The leading coupling (`QLF_FineStructureSubstrate`) is *derived by construction* from substrate
structure (the 8-twist alphabet → `2⁷`, the 3-D directional tensor → `3²`), parameter-free:

  α⁻¹_lead = 1/α_bare + d² = 128 + 9 = 137   (exact rational, no observable input)

The measured value (CODATA, q²→0 / Thomson) is α⁻¹ = 137.035999….  The construction lands on the
*integer* 137; the residual `+0.036` to the exact value is the open higher-order piece
(`alpha_exact_value_in_progress`, `Alpha.md` status box; memory `alpha-residual-036`).

This module records, machine-checked, the **bounds on that residual** (the leading value is derived;
the residual within the band is the open piece):

* **Unconditional `α⁻¹ > 137`.**  EM is abelian (`QLF_GaugeUnification.em_gauge_abelian`,
  U(1), no self-interaction) ⟹ every higher-order closure correction *screens* (is
  positive) ⟹ the IR coupling is weaker than the leading value.  A falsifiable
  before-data inequality (a measured `α⁻¹ ≤ 137` would refute the screening picture);
  CODATA `137.036 > 137`.  (`alpha_inv_gt_137`)

* **A census bracket containing the measured residual** (conditional on one `α_bare`
  per closure order — the standard one-coupling-power-per-loop counting).  Higher
  closures are counted by the closure census: total `C(2n,n) = 2,6,20,70` and
  irreducible/prime `2·Catalan(n−1) = 2,2,4,10`.  The residual is bracketed by the
  irreducible leading term below and the total census orders + tail majorant above; the
  measured `0.035999` lies strictly inside.  (`codata_residual_in_census_bracket`)

* **Falsifiability of the counting rule.**  A steeper map (`α_bare²` per order) caps the
  residual far below `0.036`, excluding it — so the data *requires* the shallow map.
  (`steep_map_excludes_codata`)

NOT proven here, by design: the length→order suppression rule itself, which would turn
the bracket into the value.  Candidate routes (memory `alpha-residual-036`): a curvature
correction to `N = d²` (`QLF_CausalDimension`), or the irreducible-closure generating
function `1 − √(1−4x)`.  Discipline: derive the rule first, evaluate second — never tune
to `0.036`.  Status: `alpha_bound_forced`, value `alpha_exact_value_in_progress`.

/-! ### The exact `√62` upper limit, via the central-binomial generating function

The total-closure tail is summed in closed form, formalizing the `√62` cap.  The one analytic
input — the central-binomial generating function `∑ C(2n,n) xⁿ = (1−4x)^(−1/2)`, a classical
theorem living above the substrate's RCA₀ floor — is named explicitly as an axiom, per the QLF
analysis-boundary convention (cf. `spectral_hilbert_polya`, `yang_mills_continuum_gap`).  The
tail is *defined constructively* from the census counts, and everything around the boundary is
proved. -/

/-- The total-closure screening tail at `α_bare = 1/128`, one `α_bare` per closure order:
    `∑_{n≥2} C(2n,n)·α_bare^(n−1)` — a convergent real series built from the census counts. -/
noncomputable def censusTail : ℝ :=
  ∑' n : ℕ, (if 2 ≤ n then (Nat.centralBinom n : ℝ) * (1 / 128 : ℝ) ^ (n - 1) else 0)

/-- **Central-binomial generating function** — the analysis-boundary input.  Classically
    `∑_{n} C(2n,n) xⁿ = (1−4x)^(−1/2)` for `|x| < 1/4`; specialized and reindexed at `x = 1/128`
    the tail above evaluates to `128·(√(32/31) − 65/64) = 512·√62/31 − 130`.  A known theorem,
    not yet in this Mathlib; named per the QLF boundary-axiom convention. -/
axiom censusTail_eq : censusTail = 512 * Real.sqrt 62 / 31 - 130

/- SKETCH — discharging `censusTail_eq` (turning this one analysis axiom into a theorem).
   Proposed plan; not yet proved (Lean here is push-to-CI). The reduction to a single classical
   input is fully elementary:

     censusTail = ∑_{n≥2} C(2n,n)·(1/128)^(n−1)
                = 128 · ∑_{n≥2} C(2n,n)·(1/128)^n              [ (1/128)^(n−1) = 128·(1/128)^n ]
                = 128 · ( G(1/128) − C(0,0) − C(2,1)·(1/128) ) [ peel the n = 0, 1 terms ]
                = 128 · ( G(1/128) − 1 − 1/64 ),
       where  G(x) := ∑_{n≥0} C(2n,n)·xⁿ = (1−4x)^(−1/2)   for |x| < 1/4   (the ONE classical input).
     G(1/128) = (1 − 4/128)^(−1/2) = (31/32)^(−1/2) = √(32/31) = 4·√62/31, so
     censusTail = 128·(4·√62/31 − 65/64) = 512·√62/31 − 130   (matches the axiom).

   So the whole axiom collapses to the central-binomial generating function. To discharge:
     1. Establish the GF as a HasSum (the genuinely-classical step):
          central_binom_genfun : ∀ x : ℝ, 0 ≤ x → x < 1/4 →
            HasSum (fun n => (Nat.centralBinom n : ℝ) * x ^ n) ((Real.sqrt (1 - 4*x))⁻¹)
        Candidate routes in this Mathlib: Newton's generalized binomial series (exponent −1/2,
        via  centralBinom n = (−4)ⁿ · (−1/2 choose n)); or the Catalan generating function
        (catalan n = centralBinom n/(n+1)); or the ODE (1−4x)·G' = 2·G, G 0 = 1 with uniqueness
        on [0, 1/4). If none is directly available, THIS named lemma becomes the (smaller, cleaner)
        boundary — a classical identity, not a magic number — already progress over `censusTail_eq`.
     2. Specialize at x = 1/128 (< 1/4 ✓):  (Real.sqrt (31/32))⁻¹ = 4·Real.sqrt 62/31
        (square both sides; `Real.sqrt_eq_iff` + `norm_num`).
     3. Reindex `censusTail`: factor the constant 128, then `HasSum.tsum_eq` minus the n = 0,1
        terms (`tsum_eq_add_tsum_ite` / `Finset.range 2`), then `field_simp`/`ring` → 512·√62/31 − 130.
   Then `axiom censusTail_eq` becomes a theorem, leaving at most the GF lemma (step 1) as the
   analysis boundary — directly closing the α-residual's biggest assumption (group target, #57). -/
