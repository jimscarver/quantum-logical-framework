# Holographic Projection in QLF:
# 3D Observable Structure as a Projection of 2-Component QuCalc Logic

## Abstract

In the Quantum Logical Framework (QLF), the primitive object is not a point in
pre-existing space but a canonical QuCalc history built from the 8-twist
alphabet

```text
^ v   < >   / \   + -
````

subject to admissibility constraints and Zero Free Action (ZFA) closure.

The current `holographic.py` does not assume Hilbert space or Pauli matrices as
primitive ontology. Instead, it starts from the QuCalc core in `twist_core.py`,
maps the prefix-action of each admissible history into a 2-component complex
logical state

$$
\psi=\begin{pmatrix}\alpha\\beta\end{pmatrix},
\qquad
\alpha = v + i h,
\qquad
\beta = d + i l,
$$

and then computes the three observable coordinates

$$
X=\psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi,\qquad
Y=\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi,\qquad
Z=\psi^\dagger \sigma_z \psi.
$$

This shows, in the precise sense implemented by the code, that 3D directional
observables are a projection of a deeper 2-component logical structure. The
same construction also produces a 1D boundary encoding by the relative phase

$$
\phi = \arg(\beta)-\arg(\alpha).
$$

Thus QLF realizes a constructive holographic bridge:
a lower-dimensional logical substrate generates higher-dimensional observables,
while still admitting a lower-dimensional boundary encoding.

## 1. The QuCalc source of truth

The refactored QLF core is `twist_core.py`. It supplies the canonical:

* 8-twist alphabet
* successor / branching law
* action calculation
* ZFA test
* adjoint construction
* breadth-first generation of admissible histories

The relevant QuCalc action is the ordered 4-tuple

$$
A(H)=(v,h,d,l),
$$

where:

* $v$ is the net vertical action
* $h$ is the net horizontal action
* $d$ is the net depth action
* $l$ is the net local / gauge action

for a history string $H$.

A stable QuCalc event is any admissible history whose net action vanishes:

$$
(v,h,d,l)=(0,0,0,0).
$$

This is the ZFA condition.

---

## 2. The current holographic bridge

The current `holographic.py` does **not** begin from an assumed Hilbert-space
qubit. It begins from QuCalc history prefixes.

For each prefix $H_k$ of a QuCalc history $H$, the code computes:

$$
A(H_k)=(v_k,h_k,d_k,l_k).
$$

It then bundles those four real logical coordinates into two complex logical
variables:

$$
\alpha_k=v_k+i h_k,\qquad
\beta_k=d_k+i l_k.
$$

These define the 2-component state

$$
\psi_k=
\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha_k\
\beta_k
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

After normalization, this becomes the bridge state used for projection.

This is the crucial step.

QLF therefore does **not** assert that the universe is fundamentally made of
Pauli matrices. It asserts that the QuCalc action algebra can be represented by
a 2-component complex state whose observable bilinears recover the familiar
3D projection structure.

---

## 3. Why 3D appears

Given the normalized 2-component state $\psi$, define

$$
X=\psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi,\qquad
Y=\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi,\qquad
Z=\psi^\dagger \sigma_z \psi.
$$

These are exactly the three real bilinear invariants computed by
`holographic.py`.

For a normalized $\psi$,

$$
X^2+Y^2+Z^2=1.
$$

So every normalized logical state lies on the unit sphere of observable
directions.

This is the precise content of the claim:

> 3D directional observables are not primitive in QLF.
> They are the projection of 2-component logical structure.

The code verifies this numerically with the routine
`verify_projection_identity(history)`, which checks that every projected prefix
lies on the unit sphere.

---

## 4. Why this is holographic

The same QuCalc-derived state also carries a 1D boundary coordinate:

$$
\phi=\arg(\beta)-\arg(\alpha).
$$

This is the relative internal phase between the two logical components.

So from the same QuCalc history we obtain:

* a **3D bulk observable** $(X,Y,Z)$
* a **1D boundary encoding** $\phi$

This is the operational meaning of holography inside QLF:

* the deeper system is 2-component logical
* the visible world is a projected higher-dimensional observable structure
* the same process is boundary-encodable by a lower-dimensional phase relation

QLF therefore realizes a constructive holographic mechanism rather than merely
borrowing the word “holographic” as a metaphor.

---

## 5. Double cover and logical closure

The current `holographic.py` also checks the familiar spinorial identity that

$$
\psi \mapsto -\psi
$$

leaves the projected 3-vector unchanged.

That is,

$$
(\psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi,,
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi,,
\psi^\dagger \sigma_z \psi)
===========================

((-\psi)^\dagger \sigma_x (-\psi),,
(-\psi)^\dagger \sigma_y (-\psi),,
(-\psi)^\dagger \sigma_z (-\psi)).
$$

This is the $SU(2)\to SO(3)$ double-cover relation in the bridge language.

In QLF terms, that means:

* logical closure occurs in the deeper 2-component layer
* observable rotation appears only after projection

Thus the bridge preserves the known 720° / 360° distinction between the logical
and the projected levels.

---

## 6. What is proved, and what is not

The current implementation proves the following:

1. QuCalc histories can be generated canonically from the core.
2. Their prefix-action can be encoded faithfully as a 2-component logical state.
3. That state projects to 3 real observables on the unit sphere.
4. The same state admits a lower-dimensional boundary encoding by relative
   phase.
5. The projected observables are invariant under the sign flip
   $\psi\mapsto-\psi$.

This is already enough to justify the statement:

> QLF generates a holographic bridge in which 2-component logical structure
> represents higher-dimensional observables.

What it does **not yet** prove is the full emergence of arbitrary continuum
geometry from one isolated bridge state. That stronger claim would require
network-level emergence: adjacency, composition, metric persistence, and
multi-history coherence across interacting logical closures.

So the precise statement is:

> The current QLF code proves the mechanism by which higher-dimensional
> observables are represented as projections of lower-dimensional logical
> structure, and it provides the constructive template by which larger
> dimensional manifolds can be built from QuCalc histories.

## 7. QuCalc-generated sample histories

Because `holographic.py` pulls histories from the QuCalc core, we can generate
admissible stable closures directly.

For example:

```python
from twist_core import generate_histories

stable = generate_histories("^", causal_horizon=8, require_zfa=True)
print(stable[:8])
```

Typical output:

```text
['^<v>', '^>v<', '^/v\\', '^\\v/', '^+v-', '^+-v', '^-v+', '^-+v']
```

All of these are QuCalc-generated stable histories.

Among them:

* `^<v>` is a purely spatial-horizontal closure
* `^/v\` exercises the depth channel
* `^+v-` exercises the local / gauge channel

The latter two are more informative for the holographic bridge because they
produce nontrivial projections.

---

## 8. Sample run A: depth channel

Using a QuCalc-generated stable history:

```python
import holographic
holographic.print_projection_report("^/v\\")
```

Sample output:

```text
=== QLF LOGICAL PROJECTION REPORT ===
History: ^/v\
Adjoint: /^\v
Admissible: True
Projected norm check: min=1.000000, max=1.000000, unit-sphere=True
Double-cover check: sign flip leaves xyz unchanged = True

Step-by-step prefixes:
  step= 0 prefix=''           action=(0, 0, 0, 0)       psi=(+1.000+0.000i, +0.000+0.000i) xyz=(+0.000, +0.000, +1.000) phi=+0.000
  step= 1 prefix='^'          action=(1, 0, 0, 0)       psi=(+1.000+0.000i, +0.000+0.000i) xyz=(+0.000, +0.000, +1.000) phi=+0.000
  step= 2 prefix='^/'         action=(1, 0, 1, 0)       psi=(+0.707+0.000i, +0.707+0.000i) xyz=(+1.000, +0.000, +0.000) phi=+0.000
  step= 3 prefix='^/v'        action=(0, 0, 1, 0)       psi=(+0.000+0.000i, +1.000+0.000i) xyz=(+0.000, +0.000, -1.000) phi=+0.000
  step= 4 prefix='^/v\\'      action=(0, 0, 0, 0)       psi=(+1.000+0.000i, +0.000+0.000i) xyz=(+0.000, +0.000, +1.000) phi=+0.000
```

### Interpretation

At step 2, the QuCalc prefix has simultaneous vertical and depth action,
which bundles into a balanced two-component state and projects to the
$X$-direction.

At step 3, only the depth component remains, so the projected state moves to
$-Z$.

At step 4, ZFA closure restores the canonical reference state and returns to
$+Z$.

This is a direct constructive example of a 3D observable trajectory arising
from QuCalc action bundled into 2-component logic.

## 9. Sample run B: local / gauge channel

Using another QuCalc-generated stable history:

```python
import holographic
holographic.print_projection_report("^+v-")
```

Sample output:

```text
=== QLF LOGICAL PROJECTION REPORT ===
History: ^+v-
Adjoint: +^-v
Admissible: True
Projected norm check: min=1.000000, max=1.000000, unit-sphere=True
Double-cover check: sign flip leaves xyz unchanged = True

Step-by-step prefixes:
  step= 0 prefix=''           action=(0, 0, 0, 0)       psi=(+1.000+0.000i, +0.000+0.000i) xyz=(+0.000, +0.000, +1.000) phi=+0.000
  step= 1 prefix='^'          action=(1, 0, 0, 0)       psi=(+1.000+0.000i, +0.000+0.000i) xyz=(+0.000, +0.000, +1.000) phi=+0.000
  step= 2 prefix='^+'         action=(1, 0, 0, 1)       psi=(+0.707+0.000i, +0.000+0.707i) xyz=(+0.000, +1.000, +0.000) phi=+1.571
  step= 3 prefix='^+v'        action=(0, 0, 0, 1)       psi=(+0.000+0.000i, +0.000+1.000i) xyz=(+0.000, +0.000, -1.000) phi=+0.000
  step= 4 prefix='^+v-'       action=(0, 0, 0, 0)       psi=(+1.000+0.000i, +0.000+0.000i) xyz=(+0.000, +0.000, +1.000) phi=+0.000
```

### Interpretation

This run is especially important because it shows the boundary coordinate
$\phi$ becoming nontrivial at step 2:

$$
\phi \approx \frac{\pi}{2}.
$$

So the same QuCalc history simultaneously produces:

* a nontrivial 3D projection $(X,Y,Z)$
* a nontrivial 1D boundary encoding $\phi$

This is the clearest operational example of the holographic structure in the
current implementation.

## 10. Conclusion

The current `holographic.py`, read together with `twist_core.py`, establishes
the following constructive result:

1. QuCalc generates admissible ZFA histories from a canonical discrete logic.
2. Each history prefix has a canonical action vector $(v,h,d,l)$.
3. That vector can be bundled into a 2-component logical state
   $\psi=(v+ih,\ d+il)^T$.
4. The Pauli bilinears of that state generate 3 real observable coordinates.
5. The same state generates a 1D boundary encoding by relative phase.
6. Sign-flip invariance shows the expected double-cover relation of the bridge.

Therefore:

> In QLF, 3D observable structure is not primitive. It is a projection of
> 2-component QuCalc logic, and the same logical state admits a lower-dimensional
> boundary encoding. This is the precise sense in which QLF generates a
> holographic representation of higher-dimensional observables from lower-
> dimensional logical structure.

The code already proves the bridge mechanism.
The next step is to extend the same construction from single histories to
networks of interacting histories, so that full emergent geometry can be shown
at the multi-event level.
