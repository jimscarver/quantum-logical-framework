# Annihilation: Left-Handed Closure Unwinding Right-Handed

**Annihilation in QLF is the topological unwinding of a left-handed closure by its right-handed Hermitian conjugate.** When a stable structure meets its exact algebraic mirror, their composite folds to the Identity in the Pauli group. The constructing-delay action that held each apart is released as massless quanta. Annihilation is the natural inverse of [MRE.md](MRE.md)'s creation event — each ZFA atom builds $\log 2$ nats of information on closure; each unwinding atom releases the same back to the vacuum.

This document synthesizes a thread that already runs through the repository — [Hermitian_Conjugacy_Proof.md](Hermitian_Conjugacy_Proof.md) for the algebra, [Electron.md](Electron.md) for the worked photon-antiphoton example, [CP-Violation-and-Chirality.md](CP-Violation-and-Chirality.md) for the cosmological residual, [Atom.md](Atom.md) for the LH/RH assignment, [Majorana_Beta_Decay.md](Majorana_Beta_Decay.md) for the chiral twist patterns — into a single statement.

## 1. Algebraic foundation

From [Hermitian_Conjugacy_Proof.md](Hermitian_Conjugacy_Proof.md), the adjoint of an event $E$ is the **reversed string of inverted twists**:

- Operator inversion: `^` ↔ `v`, `<` ↔ `>`, `/` ↔ `\`, `+` ↔ `-`
- Sequence reversal: $(AB)^\dagger = B^\dagger A^\dagger$

The proof there establishes that

$$E + E^\dagger \equiv \text{ZFA}$$

i.e. the sequential composition of an event with its exact Hermitian conjugate balances every spatial and gauge component to zero — the result is the Identity ("the Void"). Translated to the Pauli matrix algebra of [Experimental_Consistency.md §2.1](Experimental_Consistency.md):

$$\text{fold}(E) \cdot \text{fold}(E^\dagger) = \pm I$$

The annihilation event is **one ZFA closure operating on the joint particle+antiparticle history**. It is not a special new physical process; it is the standard QLF closure rule applied to a composite that happens to be a Hermitian pair at the macro scale.

## 2. Chirality as topological orientation

In QLF, chirality is the **direction** of a closed loop in the 8-twist alphabet. From [Majorana_Beta_Decay.md](Majorana_Beta_Decay.md):

- **Left-handed (LH)**: `^<v>` — up, left, down, right
- **Right-handed (RH)**: `^>v<` — up, right, down, left

These are exact Hermitian conjugates of each other in the reverse-and-invert sense of §1: reverse `^<v>` to `>v<^` and invert each twist to get `<^>v`, which is the same closed loop traversed in the opposite handedness. Both fold to the same scalar in the Pauli group (each is a 4-atom traversal of the X-Y plane), but they differ by orientation: one realizes the SU(2) half-turn in one direction, the other in the opposite direction.

For each spatial axis (Y, X, Z) the chiral pair is a Hermitian pair under Pauli folding. The four base 1/2-spin atoms of [MRE.md §2.2](MRE.md) (`^v`, `<>`, `/\`, `+-`) are the elementary Hermitian pairs at the **atom level**; chiral closures like `^<v>` are macro-level Hermitian pairs built by parallel composition of two atoms.

[Atom.md](Atom.md) makes the assignment concrete at the particle level:

- **Proton** = "Left-Handed topological knot" (positive gauge, dense)
- **Electron** = "Right-Handed fundamental fluxoid" (negative gauge, sparse)

A proton and an antiproton are exact Hermitian conjugates. A hydrogen atom (proton + electron) and an anti-hydrogen (antiproton + positron) are joint Hermitian conjugates. When they meet, every constituent atomic-level Hermitian pair unwinds simultaneously: the composite folds to the Identity.

## 3. Per-event quantum of released information

Annihilation is the inverse of [MRE.md](MRE.md)'s creation event. Each unwound 1/2-spin atom **releases** exactly $\log 2$ nats of information to the environment — the inverse of the per-event maximum information gain that built the atom in the first place. A composite of length $2k$ releases $\log \binom{2k}{k}$ nats on full unwinding, recovering $\log 2$ at $k = 1$ and the area-law scaling in the large-$k$ asymptotic.

The released information becomes the **gauge-mode quanta** ([Electron.md §3](Electron.md) calls this "re-entry unwind"; [Entropy.md](Entropy.md) calls this "Hawking radiation" in the gauge-folded case). Energy accounting follows [Maxwell.md](Maxwell.md)'s rule: $E = h \cdot (\text{released bits})$. This recovers both $E = h\nu$ for a single photon and the integrated photon-emission spectrum for a multi-atom unwinding.

The bookkeeping is exact: each atom that built one $\log 2$ of structure under construction releases the same $\log 2$ on unwinding. The vacuum frequency $f$ sets both the construction rate (per [Frequency_Synchronization.md](Frequency_Synchronization.md), $\Delta t_\text{construct} = R/f$) and the release rate (the Hawking radiation of a gauge-folded black hole is the inverse process at the same rate).

## 4. Worked examples

### 4.1 Photon–antiphoton

From [Electron.md §2](Electron.md):

- Photon (massless, forward time): `^>`
- Antiphoton (Hermitian conjugate, backward time): `v<`

Composed: `^>v<`. Pauli fold: $\sigma_y \cdot \sigma_x \cdot (-\sigma_y) \cdot (-\sigma_x) = \sigma_y \sigma_x \sigma_y \sigma_x = (\sigma_y \sigma_x)^2 = (-i \sigma_z)^2 = -I$. Closed; net spatial action = 0; the joint history achieves ZFA. The photon and antiphoton mutually unwind into the Void, releasing $\log 2 \cdot 2 = 2 \log 2$ nats of pure spatial action back to the vacuum as a second pair of massless quanta (or as a transient interference pattern in the surrounding field, depending on context).

### 4.2 Electron–positron → 2 photons

The canonical QED process $e^- + e^+ \to 2\gamma$ in QLF terms: the electron's RH fluxoid (with gauge fold `+`) meets the positron's LH antifluxoid (with gauge fold `-`). The two fluxoid halves unwind each other; the two gauge folds also unwind each other (`+` annihilates `-`). The constructing delay accumulated by each particle's gauge fold ($\Delta t = R/f$ from Frequency_Synchronization.md) is returned to the environment as two photons carrying the released action. Energy conservation $2 m_e c^2 = 2 h\nu$ is the macroscopic shadow of the bit-accounting in §3.

### 4.3 Hadron–antihadron

A composite Markov blanket ([Hadrons_Markov_Blankets.md](Hadrons_Markov_Blankets.md)) plus its Hermitian conjugate. The Borromean topology that interlocks three quarks in a proton has an exact mirror in the antiproton; pairwise unwinding releases the binding-action of every fluxoid in both blankets simultaneously. The signature is a burst of mesons and photons whose summed action accounts for the rest mass of both hadrons.

### 4.4 Hawking radiation as one-step unwinding

A gauge-folded black hole ([Frequency_Synchronization.md](Frequency_Synchronization.md), [Entropy.md](Entropy.md)) maintains its constructing delay $\Delta t = R/f$ inside its Markov blanket. ZFA closure forces an **immediate one-step horizon re-entry**: the gauge-fold unwinds and emits a Hawking pair (`+-`). The black hole is the smallest "particle" whose construction and annihilation are bound into the same algebraic event — the Hawking pair IS the released $\log 2$ nats per gauge atom.

## 5. Why the universe contains matter

In a perfectly balanced universe, every particle eventually meets its Hermitian conjugate and annihilates. The observed matter dominance requires a **residual asymmetry** that survives the post-Big-Bang annihilation epoch.

[CP-Violation-and-Chirality.md](CP-Violation-and-Chirality.md) explains this as residual-clustering dynamics: slight initial topological-density variance creates Markov-blanket attractors that out-replicate the boundary annihilation rate. In QLF terms, a cluster of one-handedness has a thicker blanket boundary, and its replication probability scales non-linearly with blanket strength. The opposite-handed cluster, with a thinner boundary, loses ground over many generations. The annihilation rate at cluster edges is bounded by gauge-fold contact rate; the replication rate inside a cluster grows super-linearly with cluster density. The cluster with the early lead becomes a topological attractor.

This is consistent with the molecular-scale **homochirality** observed in biology (almost all natural amino acids are L-isomers, sugars D-isomers; see CP-Violation-and-Chirality.md §3): the same residual-clustering dynamics that gave matter its dominance at the cosmological scale recurs at the biochemical scale. Numerical verification in [`cp_violation_sim.py`](cp_violation_sim.py).

## 6. Open work

- **Numerical demo**: enumerate Hermitian-pair annihilations in the QuCalc engine; verify $\log 2$ release per atom empirically. Companion to the construction-side BFS in `path_integral.py`.
- **Lean theorem**: `annihilation_releases_log_2_per_atom` as the companion to MRE.md's proposed `max_relative_entropy_at_half_spin`. The construction is symmetric — the same Hermitian-pair partition that bounds information gain from above bounds information release from below.
- **Beta-decay generalization**: handedness-mediated weak-interaction annihilation patterns. [Majorana_Beta_Decay.md](Majorana_Beta_Decay.md) notes that the neutron's stressed Markov blanket ejects an electron (chiral ZFA loop) and a Majorana neutrino. The full pattern in which left-handed neutrinos annihilate with right-handed antineutrinos (and the impossibility of the cross-handed product in standard EW theory) maps onto QLF chirality constraints; a clean derivation is open.
- **Cross-section calculation**: extract the QED $e^- + e^+ \to 2\gamma$ cross-section from the QLF Hermitian-pair-unwinding dynamics. Standard QED gives the Dirac formula; recovering it from atom-level annihilation rates would be a substantive test parallel to the hydrogen-spectrum derivation in [Hydrogen.md](Hydrogen.md).
