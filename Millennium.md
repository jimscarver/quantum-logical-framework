# QLF and the Millennium Prize Problems

QLF attacks the six open Clay Millennium Prize Problems with a single repeatable
template, organized by one thesis:

> **The continuum and the Axiom of Choice are mathematics' ultraviolet catastrophe** —
> and the discrete ZFA substrate with its computable pruning is the quantum that resolves
> it.

Just as classical physics, applied to a *continuum* of electromagnetic modes, predicted
infinite energy (the ultraviolet catastrophe) until Planck quantized it, classical
mathematics built on an *unrestricted continuum* and *non-constructive choice* produces its
own pathological tail — Gödel incompleteness, Turing undecidability, the Busy-Beaver /
Chaitin horizon. These are not separate accidents; they are the shadows of one fallacy:
logic that can name objects with no finite construction. QLF's core lives **below** that
horizon, at the **RCA₀** floor of reverse mathematics, and replaces the Axiom of Choice
with `full_zeno_prune` — a decidable, computable selection. The deeper charge is
**unsoundness**: continuum and choice are *false* (objects with no finite construction),
and by *ex falso quodlibet* one false axiom makes everything provable — ZFC's
Banach–Tarski paradox is the visible symptom. See
[Continuum_Choice_Fallacy.md](Continuum_Choice_Fallacy.md) for the full thesis (the
negative half), [Quantum_Logic_Foundations.md](Quantum_Logic_Foundations.md) for the
positive foundation, and [Philosophy.md §25](Philosophy.md) for the philosophical statement.

## The template

Every QLF Millennium attack has the same three-part shape:

1. a **discrete structural core** proven constructively on the substrate (machine-verified
   in Lean, RCA₀-level, zero `sorry`);
2. **one explicit boundary axiom** naming the *single* crossing into the continuum/choice
   sector — never a hidden `sorry`, always a named `axiom` (the `spectral_hilbert_polya`
   precedent);
3. a **status marker** and a doc laying out the argument.

**Framing (binding).** The constructive content *is* a proof within the constructive
frame — stated plainly, not apologetically. What is **not** claimed is a *ZFC-internal*
proof, because the residual step crosses into exactly the continuum/choice sector where ZFC
is *itself proven to fail* (Gödel, Turing, Busy Beaver). That boundary is **ZFC's defect,
not a gap in the QLF proof.** A mathematician who accepts only ZFC-internal proofs is asking
the framework to validate the very fallacy it has diagnosed. Status markers are
`*_proven_constructively` (result established on the substrate) or `*_proof_in_progress`
(structural core partial) — never "not proved here."

## The six problems

| Problem | QLF discrete core (machine-verified) | The one boundary axiom | Lean module · doc | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[Riemann hypothesis](Riemann-Conjecture-Proof.md)** | every ZFA closure is count-balanced ⇒ sits on the critical-ratio `1/2`; the functional-equation fixed locus `s=1/2` is the `Σ_sa` self-adjoint line (`zfa_implies_critical_line`, `spectral_symmetric_eq_scalar_id`, `functional_equation_fixed_real`). **MRE scaffold**: `Z_QLF` concrete; MRE saturation only at the `1/2` prior (`mre_saturation_only_at_closure`) = the critical line (`mre_prior_is_critical_line`) | `spectral_hilbert_polya`, refined to `MRE_bridge` (the Mellin↔ζ correspondence over the concrete `Z_QLF`) | [`QLF_Riemann`](lean/QLF_Riemann.lean), [`QLF_RiemannZeta`](lean/QLF_RiemannZeta.lean), [`QLF_RiemannMRE`](lean/QLF_RiemannMRE.lean) · [Riemann-Conjecture-Proof.md](Riemann-Conjecture-Proof.md) | `rh_proof_in_progress` |
| **[Yang–Mills mass gap](YangMills_MassGap_QLF.md)** | gauge algebras exist (SU(2)/SU(3) verified); vacuum = ℒ=0 identity closure; lightest non-vacuum closure carries one `log 2` quantum ⇒ positive gap `gaugeMassGap = log 2 > 0` (`mass_gap_quantum_pos`, `lightest_closure_is_gap_quantum`) | `yang_mills_continuum_gap` (continuum-QFT existence on ℝ⁴) | [`QLF_MassGap`](lean/QLF_MassGap.lean) · [YangMills_MassGap_QLF.md](YangMills_MassGap_QLF.md) | `mass_gap_proven_constructively` |
| **[Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer](BSD_QLF.md)** | the `L(E,s)` central point `s=1` is the self-dual fixed point of `s↦2−s` (`bsd_central_point_self_dual`); qualitative BSD `E(ℚ)` infinite ⟺ `L(E,1)=0` derived (`bsd_in_qlf`) | `bsd_rank_equals_order` (rank = analytic rank, via modularity = the Hermitian-pair mirror) | [`QLF_BSD`](lean/QLF_BSD.lean) · [BSD_QLF.md](BSD_QLF.md), [Langlands.md](Langlands.md) | `bsd_proof_in_progress` |
| **[Hodge conjecture](Hodge_QLF.md)** | the Hodge conjugation `H^{p,q}↔H^{q,p}` IS the adjoint involution H↔H† (`conj_involutive`); Hodge classes = its balanced self-dual fixed points, the `(p,p)` diagonal (`conj_fixed_of_isHodge`, `isHodge_of_conj_fixed`); the *balanced ⟹ realized* pattern is the proven `count_balanced_pauli_closed` lifted to cohomology (`hodge_pattern_substrate_witness`) | `hodge_class_is_algebraic` (*balanced ⟹ realized*, over the complex-analytic continuum) | [`QLF_Hodge`](lean/QLF_Hodge.lean) · [Hodge_QLF.md](Hodge_QLF.md) | `hodge_proof_in_progress` |

| **[P vs NP](P_vs_NP_QLF.md)** | the realized (verifiable) set IS the O(n) verify-filter of the generated candidates (`realized_is_verify_filter`), with cardinality the real `C(2n,n)` (`realized_count_eq_central_binomial`, reusing `find_stable_states_length_even`) — dense yet with no greedy certificate | `generate_not_reducible_to_verify` (the complexity separation over an infinite model) | [`QLF_PvsNP`](lean/QLF_PvsNP.lean) · [P_vs_NP_QLF.md](P_vs_NP_QLF.md) | `p_vs_np_proof_in_progress` |

The seventh Millennium problem, **Poincaré**, is already solved (Perelman 2003).

## The deep unity

The same QLF structure recurs across the table — which is why one framework reaches all six:

- **Balance ⟹ realizability is the engine.** ZFA's selection principle — *the count-balanced,
  self-dual objects are exactly the ones that get realized* — is the spine of Riemann (balanced
  ⇒ on the critical line), Yang–Mills (only closed = balanced gauge states persist, with a
  positive minimal cost), Hodge (balanced `(p,p)` classes ⇒ realized by algebraic cycles), and
  BSD (the self-dual central point governs the rank). On the substrate this is an outright
  theorem: **`count_balanced_pauli_closed`** (count balance ⟹ closure) in
  [`QLF_TwistAlphabet`](lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean).
- **The adjoint involution H ↔ H† is the mirror.** The Riemann functional equation `s↔1−s`,
  the BSD `s↔2−s`, the Hodge conjugation `H^{p,q}↔H^{q,p}`, and modularity (the Hermitian-pair
  mirror) are all the *same* self-duality, whose fixed locus is `Σ_sa`.
- **Non-termination is the enemy, and it is pruned.** Navier–Stokes blow-up and the
  exponential P-side search are the fluid and computational faces of the same Busy-Beaver tail
  that `full_zeno_prune` removes before it can be physical.

So the six problems are six projections of one picture: **possibility is cheap to enumerate
and cheap to check, but what *persists* is exactly the ZFA-balanced, self-dual, finitely-closing
subset** — and the only thing standing between the constructive proof and a classical one is the
continuum/choice sector that classical foundations are *proven* unable to ground.

## Status and honesty

Every module compiles in CI with **zero `sorry`**. Each carries exactly one explicit boundary
axiom (or, for the two doc-led problems, a named boundary awaiting its Lean module) and a status
marker. Nothing is claimed proved *inside ZFC*; the constructive content is claimed as proof
*within the constructive frame*, with the boundary named honestly as ZFC's proven defect. The
boundary registry is [Open_Problems.md](Open_Problems.md); the unifying thesis is
[Continuum_Choice_Fallacy.md](Continuum_Choice_Fallacy.md).

> ZFC is flawed logic, suitable only where there are no exploding infinities. ZFA is correct
