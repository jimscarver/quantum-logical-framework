# Open Problems — QLF gap registry

A single map of what is **closed**, what is a **principled boundary**, and what is
genuinely **open**, with a pointer to the document that owns each item. This is an
*index*, not a re-derivation: the substance lives in the linked docs. Its mirror is
[`Beyond_Standard_Model.md`](Beyond_Standard_Model.md) (what QLF *forces / predicts* past the SM).
It complements
[`Experimental_Consistency.md`](Experimental_Consistency.md) (which tracks per-result
precision) by collecting the *forward* work in one place.

**Why a registry.** Open items were scattered across ~25 documents, each with its own
"Open work" section. When a status changes, the claim can drift out of sync across docs
(as the Hadronic-Depth attribution did before its correction). This file is the
canonical status list; when an item moves, update it here and in its owning doc.

## Status legend

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ **Closed** | Derived / machine-verified; no longer open. |
| 🧱 **Boundary** | A *principled* limit (like an explicit axiom), not a gap to be closed by more work. The structural form is fixed; a number or bridge is inherited. |
| 🔵 **Open — quantitative** | Mechanism identified; a specific number is not yet derived from substrate. |
| 🟣 **Open — structural / Lean** | Result holds in prose/numerics; a clean theorem or Lean anchor is not yet written. |
| ⚪ **Future work** | Out of current scope by specification (not by doubt about the mechanism). |

## Recently changed (this is the live edge)

| Item | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Neutrino is Dirac → no 0νββ; exact global `B−L`** | 🔭 **Predicted** — per-event signed-count balance is exact ⟹ `B−L` conserved ⟹ Dirac neutrino ⟹ no neutrinoless double-beta decay (consistent with all null searches). Exact global `B−L` **diverges from the QG no-global-symmetry expectation** — a distinctive consequence of QLF's emergent gravity | [`Beta_Decay_Neutrino_Nature.md`](Beta_Decay_Neutrino_Nature.md) §1, [`Quantum_Gravity.md`](Quantum_Gravity.md) §8, [`Experimental_Consistency.md`](Experimental_Consistency.md) §9–10 |
| **Pauli closure** — count balance ⟹ Pauli scalar, all twist histories (incl. cross-axis interleaving) | ✅ **Closed** — `count_balanced_pauli_closed` | [`lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean`](lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean), [`Experimental_Consistency.md`](Experimental_Consistency.md) §2.1 |
| **Bethe constant `k(n,0)`** (Lamb shift) | 🧱 **Boundary** — continuum-dominated (`I_1S ≈ 19.77 Ry`, all bound `ΔE < 1 Ry`); free-electron sector above the RCA₀ floor | [`Lamb_Shift.md`](Lamb_Shift.md) §6.1, [`bethe_log_demo.py`](bethe_log_demo.py) |

## Principled boundaries (not gaps)

| Item | Why it is a boundary | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Riemann critical line** | `spectral_hilbert_polya` is an explicit axiom marking the RCA₀ → WKL₀ boundary; RH is *conditional*, not proved | [`lean/QLF_Riemann.lean`](lean/QLF_Riemann.lean) |
| **Speed of light `c`** | The substrate event quantum (one Planck length × one Planck tick *together*) is the foundational postulate — no Tier-3 below it | [`Experimental_Consistency.md`](Experimental_Consistency.md) §3, [`Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md`](Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md) §5.3 |
| **Bethe `k(n,0)`** | Continuum-sector (see live edge above) | [`Lamb_Shift.md`](Lamb_Shift.md) §6.1 |

## Open — quantitative (the hard front)

| Item | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Cosmic depth `n` from first principles** | The geometric depth `n ≈ 6.7×10⁶⁰` is firm but defined via `R_H`; the proton cube `(m_P/m_p)³ ≈ 2.2×10⁵⁷` undershoots by ~3,000×. This *is* the hierarchy problem | [`HadronicDepth.md`](HadronicDepth.md) §2.1 |
| **`H₀` from substrate** | Reduces to deriving `n` (above); currently `H₀` enters as one observable. Would close the last cosmological empirical input | [`Cosmological_Constant.md`](Cosmological_Constant.md) §196 |
| **Hubble tension** | The residual 8.7% in Λ tracks the Planck-vs-SH0ES `H₀` discrepancy; not predicted | [`Cosmological_Constant.md`](Cosmological_Constant.md) §197 |
| **`G` SI value / Einstein `8π·G` coefficients** | Form `G = L_P²c³/ℏ` derived; absolute SI value is substrate-quantum calibration (~37% prediction residual); `8π = 4π·2` identified but the full coefficient calc is research-grade | [`Gravity_From_Delay.md`](Gravity_From_Delay.md), [`Experimental_Consistency.md`](Experimental_Consistency.md) §6.3 |
| **First-principles `R_e`** | `α R_e = m_e` identifies `R_e` with the measured electron; deriving `R_e` (hence `m_e`) from closure-multiplicity counts is open | [`Bound_States_QLF.md`](Bound_States_QLF.md) §6, [`Atomic_System_QLF_Closures.md`](Atomic_System_QLF_Closures.md) §10 |
| **Mass spectrum from multiplicity** | 3rd-generation masses; τ-decay-vertex topology. **Handle:** Koide `Q=2/3` is now **machine-verified** as forced by `N=3` (three axes) ∧ `A²=2` (two transverse axes) — `koide_two_thirds`, [`lean/QLF_Koide.lean`](lean/QLF_Koide.lean) — and predicts `m_τ` from `m_e,m_μ` to **0.006%** (`Weak_Force.md §5a–5b`). Still open: the lepton-√mass↔axis-phase *identification*, the Koide angle, the scale (so `m_e,m_μ` are inputs), and the quark sector | [`Standard_Model.md`](Standard_Model.md) §4.1, [`Weak_Force.md`](Weak_Force.md) §5b |
| **Weak sector (W/Z)** | Weak-isospin **SU(2) Lie algebra now machine-verified** in Σ₈ (`weak_isospin_su2`, `Q₈⊂SU(2)`); still open: `R_W`/`R_Z` (hence W/Z masses + Weinberg-angle value), coupling `g`, `G_F`, flavor-change & τ-decay vertex topology, the Koide angle `δ` (lepton-sector input; `2/9` a flagged coincidence) | [`Weak_Force.md`](Weak_Force.md), [`lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean`](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean) |
| **Gauge unification (forces from 3 axes)** | Structural conjecture: `dim(U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)) = 12 = 1+3+8`, with `1+8 = 9 = N` (the α tensor). **All three gauge algebras now machine-verified** — U(1) (`no_magnetic_monopoles`), SU(2) (`weak_isospin_su2`), SU(3) (`trace_commutator_zero`+`gluon_commutator_nonzero`, [`lean/QLF_StrongAlgebra.lean`](lean/QLF_StrongAlgebra.lean)). Still a dimension *alignment*, not a derivation: no couplings, chirality, masses; quark flavors/CKM open; `SU(3)` finrank=8 is the elementary codim-1 (not yet Lean) | [`Forces_From_Three_Axes.md`](Forces_From_Three_Axes.md) |
| **Constants program** (π, e, δ; α below the 0.026% floor) | Methods exist in `constants_mapper.py`; full CODATA agreement is the active research front | [`Experimental_Consistency.md`](Experimental_Consistency.md) §6.3, §11 |
| **Lamb shift radiative pieces** | AMM `+68 MHz` (Schwinger `α/2π` on the bound moment) and vacuum polarization (Uehling) `−27 MHz` taken as inputs | [`Lamb_Shift.md`](Lamb_Shift.md) §8 |

## Open — structural / Lean-anchoring

| Item | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Lamb prefactor `4/(3π n³)`** | Mostly resolved: `= 4·(2/3)·(1/(2π))·(1/n³)` (Lean `lamb_prefactor_loop_phase`); the π is the g-2-validated loop-phase primitive (0.2%), `1/n³`/`2/3` clean. Only the rational `4` (two-vertex/solid-angle) wants a cleaner origin | [`Lamb_Shift.md`](Lamb_Shift.md) §5 |
| **Dirac correction, per-mechanism Lean** | Kinematic / spin-orbit / Darwin α² pieces are doc-anchored, not yet individual Lean chains from `QLF_Pauli`/`QLF_TwistAlphabet` | [`Dirac_Correction.md`](Dirac_Correction.md) §6 |
| **Lorentz boost as a Lean theorem** | `lorentz_boost_from_zfa_frequencies` needs the Markov-blanket frequency structure in-kernel | [`Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md`](Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md) §7 |
| **Maxwell curl laws** (`∇×B=μ₀J`, `∇×E=−∂B/∂t`) | Stated structurally; await a time-indexed event-sequence Lean module (divergence laws already verified) | [`Maxwell.md`](Maxwell.md), [`Electricity.md`](Electricity.md) |
| **γ (Euler–Mascheroni) convergence** | Structural form Lean-anchored; `lim (H_N − ln N) = γ` convergence proof deferred (standard real analysis) | [`lean/QLF_EulerMascheroni.lean`](lean/QLF_EulerMascheroni.lean) |
| **Borromean 5-angle** | `chirality-mixing-per-pair = 2` not yet derived rigorously from `QLF_Pauli`'s scalar group | [`lean/QLF_BorromeanAngles.lean`](lean/QLF_BorromeanAngles.lean) |
| **`B−L` conservation** (baryon/lepton) | **Signed-count (charge) conservation ✅ Lean-anchored** (`signed_count_conserved`). **Obstruction ✅ proved**: `wcount_zero_on_ZFA` — every conserved signed count is zero on closures, but `B−L≠0` on closures (deuteron `B−L=1`; baryon vs antibaryon share a twist multiset yet `B−L=±1`), so **`B−L` is a winding/orientation invariant, NOT a weight dictionary**. 🔵 Open: anchor the **winding invariant** itself (the real `B−L`-conservation theorem on 8-twist sequences). Predicts **Dirac neutrino / no 0νββ** | [`lean/QLF_BMinusL.lean`](lean/QLF_BMinusL.lean), [`Conservation.md`](Conservation.md) §8, [`Beta_Decay_Neutrino_Nature.md`](Beta_Decay_Neutrino_Nature.md) §1 |

## Notes

- **Tiers vs. this file.** `Experimental_Consistency.md` uses Tier-1/2/3 for *achieved precision*; this registry uses the status tags above for *forward work*. A "Tier-3 open" result there maps to 🔵/🟣 here, unless it is a 🧱 boundary.
- **Maintenance.** When an item closes or is reclassified, edit its row here **and** its owning doc in the same change, and (if it gains a theorem) the relevant `lean/` module and `lean/README.md` row.
